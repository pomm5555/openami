## Introduction ##

The openAMI project aims to become a flexible and highly customizable ambient intelligence and home automation solution built completely using free software, off the shelf hardware and DIY electronics.


## Goals ##

Our final goal is to provide two different frameworks:
  * a Homeautomation Framework to provide execution and communication- as well as physical infrastructure in a smarthome environment.
  * an Ambient-Intelligence Framework operating on top of the first one, to provide intelligent user assistance and an adaptive user experience.

## Current Status ##

At the current state, we are actively working on the Homeautomation part.
